# Dog-Breed Classifier
Project 2 of Udacity's DLND: In this project, we learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human face, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
